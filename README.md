# PySpark-based-Data-Deduplication-
A custom engineered deduplication framework authored in Pyspark using fuzzy logic. 

#Abstract#
In the realm of data management, deduplication is a critical process for ensuring data quality and reliability, especially when dealing with data from multiple sources. This project focuses on implementing deduplication techniques using PySpark and PySpark SQL, leveraging the power of distributed computing to efficiently identify and eliminate duplicate records. Real-world data is often riddled with inconsistencies and variations, making the task of deduplication a complex challenge. Consider, for instance, a dataset of customer records gathered from various sources for a retail company. These records may contain duplicates arising from discrepancies in customer names, addresses, or contact information. These variations can result from human error, data entry discrepancies, or differences in data formatting. To address this, fuzzy logic for string matching is employed, allowing for the detection of similar records. PySpark's distributed architecture proves instrumental in handling the computational intensity of such string matching tasks. Its lazy evaluation mechanism, which defers actual computation until necessary, significantly speeds up the deduplication process. For instance, PySpark can efficiently process massive datasets with a portion of the data being cached in-memory, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
